1. [@Material UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui) was designed to be used from the get-go with its own styling solution, implemented over JSS, but it's a great option to build fast UI interfaces.
2. [@Vanilla JavaScript]() has such an extensive verbose syntax, thats not good for website production.
3. How to keep the congruence between built in components' functionalities without everything go as mess up! ðŸ˜ª

1. Use [@Styled components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) to overriding Material UI original theme.
2. Use [@TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript-Website) for:
   - Static Typing avoids [Typos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographical_error).
   - Maintenance of Large Code Base is made easy by references.
3. Use [@Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/) for building UI components and pages in isolation ðŸ™Œ.
